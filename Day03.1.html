        Kathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal's history,
        art, culture, and economy. It has a multi-ethnic population within a
        Hindu and Buddhist majority. Religious and cultural festivities form a
        major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. The ancient
        trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu
        enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other
        cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture.
